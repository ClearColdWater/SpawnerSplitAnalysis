# SpawnerSplitAnalysis

The code was absolutely not cleaned so if you are actually trying to read the code sorry and good luck

Most of the work are in /v3 with a few useful tools in the root folder

If and when I feel like it I will make it actually usable

And also don't laugh at me I rarely use github at all
